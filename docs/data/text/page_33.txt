5.3 Measure
The MEASURE function employs quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-method tools, tech-
niques, and methodologies to analyze, assess, benchmark, and monitor AI risk and related
impacts. ItusesknowledgerelevanttoAIrisksidentifiedinthe MAP functionandinforms
the MANAGE function. AI systems should be tested before their deployment and regu-
larly while in operation. AI risk measurements include documenting aspects of systemsâ€™
functionalityandtrustworthiness.

and human-AI configurations. Processes developed or adopted in the MEASURE function
should include rigorous software testing and performance assessment methodologies with
associated measures of uncertainty, comparisons to performance benchmarks, and formal-
izedreportinganddocumentationofresults. Processesforindependentreviewcanimprove
the effectiveness of testing and can mitigate internal biases and potential conflicts of inter-
est.
