3. AI Risks and Trustworthiness
For AI systems to be trustworthy, they often need to be responsive to a multiplicity of cri-
teria that are of value to interested parties. Approaches which enhance AI trustworthiness
can reduce negative AI risks. This Framework articulates the following characteristics of
trustworthy AI and offers guidance for addressing them. Characteristics of trustworthy AI
systems include: valid and reliable, safe, secure and resilient, accountable and trans-
parent, explainable and interpretable, privacy-enhanced, and fair with harmful bias
managed. Creating trustworthy AI requires balancing each of these characteristics based
on the AI systemâ€™s context of use. While all characteristics are socio-technical system at-
tributes, accountability and transparency also relate to the processes and activities internal
to an AI system and its external setting. Neglecting these characteristics can increase the
probabilityandmagnitudeofnegativeconsequences.

Addressing AItrustworthiness characteristics individuallywill not ensure AIsystem trust-
worthiness; tradeoffs are usually involved, rarely do all characteristics apply in every set-
ting, and some will be more or less important in any given situation. Ultimately, trustwor-
