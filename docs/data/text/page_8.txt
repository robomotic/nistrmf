Part 2 comprises the “Core” of the Framework. It describes four specific functions to help
organizations address the risks of AI systems in practice. These functions – GOVERN,
MAP, MEASURE, and MANAGE – are broken down further into categories and subcate-
gories. While GOVERN applies to all stages of organizations’ AI risk management pro-
cesses and procedures, the MAP, MEASURE, and MANAGE functions can be applied in AI
system-specificcontextsandatspecificstagesoftheAIlifecycle.
Additional resources related to the Framework are included in the AI RMF Playbook,

Development of the AI RMF by NIST in collaboration with the private and public sec-
tors is directed and consistent with its broader AI efforts called for by the National AI
Initiative Act of 2020, the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence recom-
mendations, and the Plan for Federal Engagement in Developing Technical Standards and
Related Tools. Engagement with the AI community during this Framework’s development
– via responses to a formal Request for Information, three widely attended workshops,

RMF 1.0 as well as AI research and development and evaluation conducted by NIST and
others. Priority research and additional guidance that will enhance this Framework will be
captured in an associated AI Risk Management Framework Roadmap to which NIST and
