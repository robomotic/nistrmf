Privacy and cybersecurity risk management considerations and approaches are applicable
in the design, development, deployment, evaluation, and use of AI systems. Privacy and
cybersecurity risks are also considered as part of broader enterprise risk management con-
siderations,whichmayincorporateAIrisks. AspartoftheefforttoaddressAItrustworthi-
ness characteristics such as “Secure and Resilient” and “Privacy-Enhanced,” organizations
may consider leveraging available standards and guidance that provide broad guidance to
organizationstoreducesecurityandprivacyrisks,suchas,butnotlimitedto,theNISTCy-
bersecurityFramework,theNISTPrivacyFramework,theNISTRiskManagementFrame-
work, and the Secure Software Development Framework. These frameworks have some
features in common with the AI RMF. Like most risk management approaches, they are
outcome-based rather than prescriptive and are often structured around a Core set of func-
tions, categories, and subcategories. While there are significant differences between these
frameworks based on the domain addressed – and because AI risk management calls for
addressingmanyothertypesofrisks–frameworkslikethosementionedabovemayinform
securityandprivacyconsiderationsinthe MAP, MEASURE,and MANAGE functionsofthe
AIRMF.
At the same time, guidance available before publication of this AI RMF does not compre-
hensively address many AI system risks. For example, existing frameworks and guidance
areunableto:
• adequatelymanagetheproblemofharmfulbiasinAIsystems;
• confrontthechallengingrisksrelatedtogenerativeAI;
• comprehensivelyaddresssecurityconcernsrelatedtoevasion,modelextraction,mem-
bershipinference,availability,orothermachinelearningattacks;
• accountforthecomplexattacksurfaceofAIsystemsorothersecurityabusesenabled

• considerrisksassociatedwiththird-partyAItechnologies,transferlearning,andoff-
labelusewhereAIsystemsmaybetrainedfordecision-makingoutsideanorganiza-
tion’ssecuritycontrolsortrainedinonedomainandthen“fine-tuned”foranother.
Both AI and traditional software technologies and systems are subject to rapid innovation.
Technology advances should be monitored and deployed to take advantage of those devel-
opmentsandworktowardsafutureofAIthatisbothtrustworthyandresponsible.
