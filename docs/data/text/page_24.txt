4. Effectiveness of the AI RMF
Evaluations of AI RMF effectiveness – including ways to measure bottom-line improve-
ments in the trustworthiness of AI systems – will be part of future NIST activities, in
conjunctionwiththeAIcommunity.
Organizations and other users of the Framework are encouraged to periodically evaluate
whether the AI RMF has improved their ability to manage AI risks, including but not lim-
itedtotheirpolicies,processes,practices,implementationplans,indicators,measurements,
and expected outcomes. NIST intends to work collaboratively with others to develop met-
rics, methodologies, and goals for evaluating the AI RMF’s effectiveness, and to broadly
shareresultsandsupportinginformation. Frameworkusersareexpectedtobenefitfrom:
• enhanced processes for governing, mapping, measuring, and managing AI risk, and

• improved awareness of the relationships and tradeoffs among trustworthiness char-
acteristics,socio-technicalapproaches,andAIrisks;
